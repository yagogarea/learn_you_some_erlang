# Learn You Some Erlang

This repository documents my journey of learning the Erlang programming language through practical examples and code snippets. The primary reference for this learning adventure is the book "Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good!" by Fred Hebert.

## About Erlang
[Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/) is a functional and concurrent programming language designed for building scalable and fault-tolerant systems. Its unique features, such as lightweight processes and message passing, make it well-suited for developing distributed and reliable applications.

## Learning Resources
- **Book:** ["Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good!"](https://learnyousomeerlang.com/) by Fred Hebert
- **Official Erlang Documentation:** [Erlang Documentation](https://www.erlang.org/doc/)

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into different sections, each identified by a numeric code (e.g., `xx_section`). Each section consists of a `src/` folder for code and a `doc/` folder for notes.

- **`xx_section/`**
  - **`src/`**: Contains Erlang source code files for the section.
  - **`doc/`**: Personal notes and insights for the section.

## Installation
To get started with the code in a specific section, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yagogarea/learn_you_some_erlang.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd learn_you_some_erlang/xx_section`
3. Explore the `src/` and `doc/` directories for code samples and notes.

## Learning Path
Feel free to follow my learning path by exploring the code examples and attempting to solve the challenges embedded in each program. The journey of learning Erlang becomes more enriching when you actively engage with the code and strive to understand and solve problems.

## Contributions
Contributions, feedback, and suggestions are highly encouraged! If you spot any improvements or have insights to share, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Let's collaboratively explore the world of Erlang.
